Install native pods with ```npm i``` then ```npx pod-install```

Run example in iOS: 
```npm run ios```

If error occurs using ```npm run ios``` its recommended you run the example directly in Xcode: (You might need to select a development team in Xcode or otherwise [setup your react-native env](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)). These errors won't be communicated very clearly if relying soley on ```npm run ios```.

Running in Xcode directly:
- Open ```ios/example.xcworkspace``` with Xcode:
- Ensure build target is selected under ```Product > Destination > (Target)``` (Note: Must test on a physical device in order for bluetooth to work)
- Run ```Product > Run```

Run example in Android:

```npm run android```
